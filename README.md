JS-conf Yerevan ideas

- Just lectures and talks are boring: have an itro lection + workshop
- Workshop participans should have laptops with pre-installed software
- Workshop participants should have relative background
- The inital workshops might be invite-only. To participate you should pass the relevant topic quiz.
